# Agario XPBOT (a.k.a Facebots)

Facebots are bots that login with your facebook account and gain mass (a.k.a XP) yor you.

# Installation
- you need to install nodejs before: https://nodejs.org/
  - in a terminal shell, do ```npm install agario-client && git clone https://github.com/camilleeyries/AGAR-XPBOT.git```
  - login to facebook.com and put the ```c_user```, ```datr``` and ```xs``` cookie in the script at his respective place (var myaccount = {blablabla};)
  - do ``` cd AGAR-XPBOT && node Facebots.js```
  - Star this repo to support me and then...
  - ENJOY !!!

# Tuning
- you can modify the amount of bots by modifying the ```amount``` variable

# TODO
- Set a timeout to connect bot to avoid the "connection lost ! !" error ALREADY DO !
- make a stat board with mass average using ansi escapes codes.

# if you have an issue
- don't cry !
- make sure you have the latest version of agario-client
- verify your facebooks account information ( I will make a video tutorial later )

# If you can't fix your issue yourself, then open an issue (please add tags, I LOVE TAGS !)
